# allitebooks.com :books:
* allitebooks.py | you can index the entire allitbooks.com into a .csv file and download the ebooks in a .zip format which will be incremental (means even if your download stops in between you can start again from there...)
* allitebooks_db.py | this script will create a sqlite database of the entire website and download the ebooks along.
* there is also a flask webapp where you can see the book db file in list format.(Note..currently list is limited to 100 record)
